Description
-----------

MiniLight is a minimal global illumination renderer. See the main MiniLight
readme for a general description.

This Common Lisp translation probably violates the spirit of translation in
a couple of potentially major ways: I have chosen to replace the ray implementation
with the slope ray algorithm (cited in the code) and I've decided, as a first step, to
make things like rays and bounding boxes CLOS objects as well.
